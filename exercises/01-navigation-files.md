# Exercise 01: Navigation & Files

## Goal
Learn how to move around in the Linux filesystem and work with files/directories.

## Tasks
1. Create a directory called `playground` in your home folder.
2. Inside it, create three files: `alpha.txt`, `beta.txt`, `gamma.txt`.
3. Write "Linux is power" inside `alpha.txt`.
4. Copy `alpha.txt` into a file named `delta.txt`.
5. Move `gamma.txt` into a subfolder called `hidden_lab`.
6. Rename `beta.txt` to `omega.txt`.
7. Delete `delta.txt`.

## Verification
- Use `ls -l` to confirm your changes.
- Use `cat` to check file contents.
